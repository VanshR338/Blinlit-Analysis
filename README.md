# Blinlit-Analysis
This is a comprehensive retail analytics project that analyzes Blinkit's grocery sales data using both Power BI for visualization and Python for predictive modeling. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics capabilities from data preparation to actionable business insights.
Project Overview
The analysis focuses on understanding Blinkit's sales performance across multiple dimensions including product categories, outlet characteristics, customer ratings, and regional distribution. It combines descriptive analytics with machine learning to provide both historical insights and predictive capabilities.
Key Components
1. Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)

Data Preparation: Raw grocery sales data was cleaned in Power Query, with standardized column names and proper data type formatting
Data Modeling: Implemented a star schema architecture with fact tables (Sales) and dimension tables (Items, Outlets, Categories)
DAX Measures: Created custom KPIs including Total Sales, Average Rating, Average Item Weight, and Discount Impact
Interactive Dashboard: Built with slicers for dynamic filtering by Outlet Size, Item Type, and Location

2. Machine Learning Component (Python)

Exploratory Data Analysis: Distribution analysis, correlation studies, and feature relationships
Predictive Modeling: Random Forest Regressor to predict sales based on various features
Feature Engineering: Preprocessing pipeline with imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding
Model Evaluation: Performance measured using RÂ² Score and RMSE metrics

# Business Insights Discovered
